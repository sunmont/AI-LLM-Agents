# Agentic AI Orchestration Platform

A comprehensive platform for building, deploying, and managing agentic AI systems using LangGraph, LlamaIndex Agents, and Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Features

### Core Orchestration
- **LangGraph-based workflow orchestration** with state management
- **Task decomposition** and parallel execution
- **Human-in-the-loop workflows** with approval gates
- **Conversation memory** and knowledge graph integration

### Agent Skills
- **Modular, reusable skills** for domain-specific tasks
- **SOP execution** with compliance tracking
- **Multi-step task automation** with validation
- **Tool invocation** with standardized interfaces

### MCP Integration
- **Standardized tool access** through Model Context Protocol
- **Multi-agent coordination** for complex tasks
- **Secure service integration** with audit logging
- **External data source connectivity**

### Model Optimization
- **Fine-tuning** with TRL (SFT, DPO, PPO)
- **GRPO-based reinforcement learning** for task alignment
- **Performance optimization** and evaluation
- **Model comparison** and versioning

### MLOps Infrastructure
- **CI/CD pipelines** for AI services
- **Docker containerization** with GPU support
- **MLflow model registry** and experiment tracking
- **Infrastructure-as-code** deployment (Terraform, Kubernetes)
